# Writing Good Documentation

 ## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

 Codeblocks in **merkdown make it very** easy for eeach people to *copy, paste, share code*.
 A good engineer codelblock whenever possible

 Because it allows other to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.



- In order to create codeblock in markdown you need to use three backtick (`)
- Bot to be confused with quotation (')

 ```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks.

 ```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```
